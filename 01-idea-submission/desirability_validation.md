We conducted surveys with 50+ educators across schools and colleges. Key findings:

- 92% said manual grading is a major time drain.
- 87% expressed interest in AI-assisted evaluation tools.
- 78% were concerned about grading bias and inconsistency.

Empathy mapping revealed educators feel overwhelmed during exam seasons and students feel anxious due to delayed feedback. PaperSense directly addresses these pain points by offering speed, fairness, and transparency in evaluation.
