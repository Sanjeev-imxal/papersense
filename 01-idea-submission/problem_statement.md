Manual grading of academic papers is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often biased. Educators face challenges in evaluating large volumes of subjective responses, leading to delays and dissatisfaction among students. The lack of scalable, fair, and efficient assessment tools hampers academic productivity and feedback quality.

PaperSense aims to solve this by automating the evaluation of written academic responses using AI, ensuring faster, fairer, and more consistent grading.
