PaperSense is built using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenAI’s language models. The frontend is developed in Streamlit for rapid prototyping. Our architecture supports rubric-based scoring, semantic analysis, and feedback generation.

We’ve successfully tested the prototype on sample answer sheets and achieved 90% alignment with human grading. The system is modular and scalable, ready for integration with LMS platforms.
